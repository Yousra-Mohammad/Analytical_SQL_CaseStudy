# Analytical SQL Case Study

This repository contains a case study focused on analyzing customer behavior and implementing a monetary model using SQL analytical functions. The goal is to gain insights into customer purchasing patterns, segment customers based on their behavior, and answer specific questions using the provided dataset.

## Background
The dataset consists of purchasing transactions from customers, and the objective is to understand customer behavior in order to target them effectively, increase sales and revenue, improve customer retention, and reduce churn.

## Questions to Answer

### Q1 - Analytical SQL Queries
Using the OnlineRetail dataset, you will write at least 5 analytical SQL queries that tell a story about the data. Each query should be accompanied by a brief description of its business meaning.

### Q2 - Implementing a Monetary Model and Customer Segmentation
After exploring the data, you are required to implement a monetary model to analyze customer behavior and segment them into specific groups. The segmentation will be based on recency, frequency, and monetary values. The following customer groups will be assigned:

- Champions
- Loyal Customers
- Potential Loyalists
- Recent Customers
- Promising Customers
- Customers Needing Attention
- At Risk Customers
- Can't Lose Them Customers
- Hibernating Customers
- Lost Customers

The segmentation will involve calculating the average scores of frequency and monetary values to reduce the complexity of marketing strategies.

### Q3 - Daily Purchasing Transactions Dataset
You are provided with a daily purchasing transactions dataset for customers. The following questions need to be answered:

a) What is the maximum number of consecutive days a customer made purchases?

b) On average, how many days/transactions does it take a customer to reach a spending threshold of 250 L.E?

## Expected Outcome

Upon completing the case study, you will have gained insights into customer behavior, implemented a monetary model for segmentation, and answered specific questions about the dataset.

Please refer to the provided documentation and SQL queries within this repository to explore the analysis and findings in more detail.
